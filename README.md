This website was made to present our earth day project to raise awareness about environmental issues.
We envisioned an arcade game concept that, in order to play, you must recycle a can or a bottle (like in super markets). 
The arcade itself was the most demanding part of the project, as it took us over 200 hours of design, creation, obtention of materials, and much more.
The arcade was made entirely out of re-used components and eco-friendly materials and paint.
The game itself "Planète Désemption" is a post-apoclyptic game that is inspired by the Fallout franchise, but instead of everything getting destroyed by nuclear war, it's the result of heavily neglecting the earth.

The whole project was awarded and comissionned by the animation service of Collège Maisonneuve.
